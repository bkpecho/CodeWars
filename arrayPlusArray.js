/* 

I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
  return arr1.reduce((a, b) => a + b) + arr2.reduce((a, b) => a + b); //something went wrong
}
