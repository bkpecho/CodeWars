/* 

You can print your name on a billboard ad. Find out how much it will cost you. Each character has a default price of £30, but that can be different if you are given 2 parameters instead of 1.

You can not use multiplier "*" operator.

If your name would be Jeong-Ho Aristotelis, ad would cost £600. 20 leters * 30 = 600 (Space counts as a character).

  for (let i = 0; i < name.length; i++) {
    sum += price;
