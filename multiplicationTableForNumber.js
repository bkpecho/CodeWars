/* 

Your goal is to return multiplication table for number that is always an integer from 1 to 10.

For example, a multiplication table (string) for number == 5 looks like below:

1 * 5 = 5
2 * 5 = 10
3 * 5 = 15
4 * 5 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
6 * 5 = 30
7 * 5 = 35
8 * 5 = 40
9 * 5 = 45
10 * 5 = 50
P. S. You can use \n in string to jump to the next line.

Note: newlines should be added between rows, but there should be no trailing newline at the end. If you're unsure about the format, look at the sample tests.

function multiTable(number) {
  let str = '';

  for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    str += `${i} * ${number} = ${i * number}\n`;
  }

  return str.slice(0, -1);
}
