/* 

*** No Loops Allowed ***

You will be given an array a and a value x. All you need to do is check whether the provided array contains the value, without using a loop.

Array can contain numbers or strings. x can be either. Return true if the array contains the value, false if not. With strings you will need to account for case.

Looking for more, loop-restrained fun? Check out the other kata in the series:

function check(a, x) {
  return a.includes(x);
}
