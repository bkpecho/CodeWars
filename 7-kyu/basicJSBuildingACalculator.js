/* 

Let's build a calculator.

This is very basic Javascript kata.

The test expects you to provide a Calculator object with the following methods:

Calculator.add()
Calculator.subtract()
Calculator.multiply()
Calculator.divide()
Each method expects two arguments, so for instance:

Calculator.add(1,4) should return 5.

Only integers are expected to be passed in as arguments, and the divide method should return 'false' when trying the divide by zero.

*/

var Calculator = {
  add: (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
  },
  subtract: (a, b) => {
    return a - b;
  },
  multiply: (a, b) => {
    return a * b;
  },
  divide: (a, b) => {
    return a && b ? a / b : false;
  }
};
