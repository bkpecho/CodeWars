Your task is to add a new property usersAnswer to every object in the array questions. The value of usersAnswer should be set to null. The solution should work for array of any length.

For example:

var questions = [{
    question: "What's the currency of the USA?",
    choices: ["US dollar", "Ruble", "Horses", "Gold"],
    corAnswer: 0
}, {
    question: "Where was the American Declaration of Independence signed?",
    choices: ["Philadelphia", "At the bottom", "Frankie's Pub", "China"],
    corAnswer: 0
}];
After adding the property the result should be:

var questions = [{
    question: "What's the currency of the USA?",
    choices: ["US dollar", "Ruble", "Horses", "Gold"],
    corAnswer: 0,
    usersAnswer: null
}, {
    question: "Where was the American Declaration of Independence signed?",
    choices: ["Philadelphia", "At the bottom", "Frankie's pub", "China"],
    corAnswer: 0,
    usersAnswer: null
}];
The questions array is already defined for you and is not the same as the one in the example.

*/

questions.forEach(function (question) {
  question.usersAnswer = null;
});
