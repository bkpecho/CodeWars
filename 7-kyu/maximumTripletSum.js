/* 

Given an array/list [] of n integers , find maximum triplet sum in the array Without duplications .

Notes :
Array/list size is at least 3 .

Array/list numbers could be a mixture of positives , negatives and zeros .

Repetition of numbers in the array/list could occur , So (duplications are not included when summing).

Input >> Output Examples
1- maxTriSum ({3,2,6,8,2,3}) ==> return (17)
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum {6,8,3} in order , their sum is (17)

Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once .

2- maxTriSum ({2,1,8,0,6,4,8,6,2,4}) ==> return (18)
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum {8, 6, 4} in order , their sum is (18) ,

Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once .

3- maxTriSum ({-7,12,-7,29,-5,0,-7,0,0,29}) ==> return (41)
Explanation:
As the triplet that maximize the sum {12 , 29 , 0} in order , their sum is (41) ,

Note : duplications are not included when summing , (i.e) the numbers added only once .

function maxTriSum(numbers) {
  let arr = [...new Set(numbers)].sort((a, b) => a - b);
  return arr[arr.length - 1] + arr[arr.length - 2] + arr[arr.length - 3];
