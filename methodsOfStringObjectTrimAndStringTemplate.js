This is the last lesson about the string object, we will learn the two knowledge used to format the string.

The first is a simple method: trim(). Usage is very simple:

stringObject.trim()
Its role is very simple too: remove the whitespace at the edge of the string. example:

var str="             abc                ";
console.log(str.trim());
str="\n\n\n\nabc\t\t\t"
console.log(str.trim());
//output:
abc
abc
Various non visible characters such as space tab are called whitespace. more detailed information please refer to:whitespace

trim() only remove whitespace at edge of string, whitespace in the middle of the string will not be removed.

var str="  a b c  ";
console.log(str.trim());

//output:
a b c
Next we will learn a new member of the ES6: string template, We look at the following code:

var s1="My name is John.";
var s2='My name is John.';
var s3=`My name is John.`;
Are their values equal? Yes, they are equal. Do you see the difference in s2 and s3? Bingo! single quotes ' and backtick ` are different. Of course, this is not the biggest difference between them. Using double quotes " or single quotes ', we get a fixed string value. Use the backtick `, we are defining a string template.

We can use ${variable} insert a variable into string template. like this:

var a=1,b=2;
console.log(`${a} + ${b} = ${a+b}`);

//output:
1 + 2 = 3
Or we can write this:

function plus(a,b){
  console.log(`${a} + ${b} = ${a+b}`);
}
plus(1,2);
plus(3,4);

//output:
1 + 2 = 3
3 + 4 = 7
Isn't it interesting? There are more interesting things to happen. When the string template appears in the back of a function, It will be used as a parameter. Look at the following example:

function repeatIt(s){
  console.log(`${s} ${s} ${s}`);
}
repeatIt `a`;
repeatIt `ab`;

//output:
a a a
ab ab ab
Ok, lesson is over. let's do some task.

Task
Coding in function fiveLine, function accept 1 parameter:s. s is a string.

Please return a string of 5 lines(newline symbol is \n). The first line has one s; Second line have two s; and so on..Fifth line have five s;

Note1: The two sides of the parameter s may contain some whitespace, please clear them before using s.

Note2: Using a string template can make your job easier.

Example:

fiveLine("  a") should return "a\naa\naaa\naaaa\naaaaa"
a
aa
aaa
aaaa
aaaaa       <---The effect when you console.log it
fiveLine("  xy ") 
should return "xy\nxyxy\nxyxyxy\nxyxyxyxy\nxyxyxyxyxy"
xy
xyxy
xyxyxy
xyxyxyxy
xyxyxyxyxy  <---The effect when you console.log it

*/

function fiveLine(s) {
  s = s.trim();
  return `${s}\n${s.repeat(2)}\n${s.repeat(3)}\n${s.repeat(4)}\n${s.repeat(5)}`;
}
